# TigerConnect .NET SDK Change Log

## 1.1.1  (20160311)

#### Windows DotNet Service Project 
* The new Windows service sample project has been added to the solution.  This is the ideal template to use for developers who wish to create a TigerConnect "bot" using the .NET platform.

#### Web Console

* Added a new default page as a simple homepage.
* Added basic search functionality.  A new version will be released early next week that will have the web samples for metadata and search implemented completely.
